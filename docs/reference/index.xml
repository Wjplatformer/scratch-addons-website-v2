Each addon is inside its own folder as well. In order to tell the addon loader how the addon plans to work, addons use a standard addon.json file located at the root of the addon&amp;rsquo;s folder.
name Type String Required ✔️ The name of the addon. Must be Sentence case.
It needs to be relatively short and consistent with other addon&amp;rsquo;s names.
