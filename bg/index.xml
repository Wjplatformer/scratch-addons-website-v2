Actually, an addon isn&amp;rsquo;t much more than a userscript, a userstyle, or a combination of the two. If any of these are related, then we make them part of the same addon, under a single name. For example, the &amp;ldquo;Scratch 3 Developer Tools&amp;rdquo; addon has a userscript in charge of adding a find box to the editor, and a userstyle that adds CSS to that box.</description></item><item><title>Quick Start</title><link>https://scratchaddons.com/bg/docs/getting-started/quick-start/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scratchaddons.com/bg/docs/getting-started/quick-start/</guid><description>Installing Let&amp;rsquo;s get started by installing Scratch Addons.

Userscripts allow you to run code along Scratch pages - you can do stuff like add buttons, enhance the Scratch editor, or anything you can imagine.
How do I add a userscript? Make sure to refresh Scratch Addons from chrome://extensions after doing any changes to your addon.
Go to the manifest of your addon (addon.json) and add a property called userscripts&amp;quot;.
This property must be an array.</description></item><item><title>Userstyles</title><link>https://scratchaddons.com/bg/docs/develop/addon-types/userstyles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scratchaddons.com/bg/docs/develop/addon-types/userstyles/</guid><description>What are they?
